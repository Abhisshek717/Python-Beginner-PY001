```python
#ex1.0.4
data1 = "String" # String
data2 = 2 # Integer
data3 = 3.1 # Float
print(data1)
print(data2)
print(data3)
```
```Python
#ex1.0.5
data1 = str("String") # String
data2 = int(2) # Integer
data3 = float(3.1) # Float
print(data1)
print(data2)
print(data3)
```
```python

number1 = 1
number2 = 2
print(number1 + number2)
print(number1 - number2)
print(number1 * number2)
print(number1 / number2)
```
```python
#ex1.0.9
name = "zander"
number = 1
